# statements-Loops

To study and implement C++ decision making statements Loops

# Aim:

To study and implement decision-making statements and loops in C++ in order to understand the control flow and structure of iterative and conditional programming constructs.

# Procedure:

Write a program using a for loop to execute a block of code for a fixed number of iterations.

Implement a while loop to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true.

Use a do-while loop to demonstrate post-condition iteration (loop executes at least once).

Combine decision-making statements (if, if-else, if-else-if) with loops to control flow based on dynamic conditions.

Take input from the user to define loop boundaries or control variables.

Use nested loops to create pattern-based outputs (e.g., star or number patterns).

Display appropriate output after each loop execution to visualize results.

Compile and run each program to verify correct execution and logic.


# Algorithm:

Angled Triangle Pattern:


Step 1: Start

Step 2: Initialize loop variable i = 1

Step 3: Repeat while i ≤ 5 (for each row):

  a. Initialize j = 1
  
  b. Repeat while j ≤ i (print stars):
  
    i. Print "*"
    
    ii. Increment j
    
  c. Move to a new line after inner loop
  
  d. Increment i
  
Step 4: End


Sequential Number Triangle Pattern


Step 1: Start

Step 2: Set rows ← 4 and number ← 1

Step 3: Repeat for i from 1 to rows:

  a. Repeat for j from 1 to i:
  
    i. Print number followed by a space
    
    ii. Increment number by 1
  
  b. Move to a new line after the inner loop

Step 4: End

Conclusion

In this study, we have explored and incorporated C++ decision statements (if, else if, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while) in order to control the flow of a program. These basic constructs are important in addressing many problems where repeated activity or conditional activity is involved. Using nested loops and nests of if conditions, we were able to create all sorts of output patterns as well as logical programs. Experiencing and mastering these concepts allows us to build an appropriate foundation for completing useful and organized C++ applications.
