# statements-Loops

To study and implement C++ decision making statements Loops

Aim:

To study and implement decision-making statements and loops in C++ in order to understand the control flow and structure of iterative and conditional programming constructs.

Procedure:

Write a program using a for loop to execute a block of code for a fixed number of iterations.

Implement a while loop to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true.

Use a do-while loop to demonstrate post-condition iteration (loop executes at least once).

Combine decision-making statements (if, if-else, if-else-if) with loops to control flow based on dynamic conditions.

Take input from the user to define loop boundaries or control variables.

Use nested loops to create pattern-based outputs (e.g., star or number patterns).

Display appropriate output after each loop execution to visualize results.

Compile and run each program to verify correct execution and logic.

Algorithm:

Angled Triangle Pattern:
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize loop variable i = 1
Step 3: Repeat while i ≤ 5 (for each row):
  a. Initialize j = 1
  b. Repeat while j ≤ i (print stars):
    i. Print "*"
    ii. Increment j
  c. Move to a new line after inner loop
  d. Increment i
Step 4: End
